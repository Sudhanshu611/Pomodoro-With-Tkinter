# Pomodoro Timer

A simple Pomodoro timer built using Python's `tkinter` library with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. This timer helps you practice the Pomodoro technique, which involves working for 25 minutes followed by a 5-minute break. The application provides a simple user interface to start the timer for both work and break sessions.

## Features

- **Work and Break Sessions**: The app provides a 25-minute work session followed by a 5-minute break session.
- **Simple User Interface**: Built with `tkinter`, the interface is straightforward, with buttons to start work and break sessions.
- **Notification Alerts**: Displays a message box when the work or break session is over.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `tkinter` (usually comes pre-installed with Python)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/pomodoro-timer.git
    cd pomodoro-timer
    ```

2. **Ensure Python 3.x is installed**: 
    If you don't have Python installed, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Usage

1. **Run the Pomodoro Timer**:
    ```bash
    python pomodoro.py
    ```

2. **Interface Overview**:
   - Click the **"Start"** button to begin a 25-minute work session.
   - Click the **"Break"** button to start a 5-minute break session.
   - The timer will count down, and a notification will appear once the timer hits zero.

## How It Works

1. **Timer Mechanism**:
   - The timer counts down from 25 minutes for the work session and from 5 minutes for the break session.
   - The `divmod` function is used to calculate minutes and seconds from the total seconds remaining.

2. **Notifications**:
   - When the work timer ends, a message box will notify you to start your break.
   - Similarly, when the break timer ends, a message box will notify you to start working again.

## Code Overview

The code is divided into different functions:

- **`working_time(self, timer)`**: Updates the timer on the interface every second.
- **`work_(self)`**: Starts a 25-minute work session.
- **`break_(self)`**: Starts a 5-minute break session.
- **`main(self)`**: Sets up the UI with labels, buttons, and their respective configurations.

## Future Enhancements

- Add a settings panel to customize the work and break durations.
- Add sound notifications when the timer ends.
- Implement a progress tracker for completed Pomodoro sessions.
